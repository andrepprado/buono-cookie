# Buono Cookie – Case Study

A complete case study developed as part of my professional portfolio, showcasing UI/UX strategy, brand identity, design components, visual hierarchy, responsive layout and project structuring using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This page demonstrates how I translated a real business concept — Buono Cookie, a handmade cookie brand — into a modern digital presentation with focus on aesthetics, usability, and storytelling.
